# System Design

This folder documents the backend system architecture and implementation logic for each major subsystem in the application.

## Purpose

Since the features are already thoroughly defined in the frontend specifications and the Psyche Analysis documentation, the backendâ€™s primary role is to realize those features.
This folder instead contains system design docs to plan and document the implementation in detail.

## Guidelines

- Clarify the internal logic and responsibilities of each subsystem
- Serve as the single source of truth for backend implementation details
- When in doubt, prioritize clarity over formality

## Structure

Each file in this folder corresponds to a distinct subsystem.
