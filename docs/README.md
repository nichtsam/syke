# Welcome to Docs

Hi there — I’ll walk you through everything so you can quickly get the big picture.

## The Goals

Let’s start with the project’s purpose.
PsyTrack helps you journal and analyze your psychological state.

We start with [the User Stories](./user-stories.md), which outline the main goals we want to achieve.

Right after that, you can check out [Plain Explanation](./plain-explanation.md). It gives a casual, story-like overview of the project, explaining what it records, why it matters, and the main challenges. This is a great way to get the big picture before diving into technical details.

Then, [the Frontend Specifications](./frontend/features/README.md) turn the goals into concrete feature plans, showing how the UI will support them.

## Basic Background Understanding

Once you know what we’re building, it’s worth learning the theory behind it.
Check out [Psyche Analysis](./psyche-analysis/README.md) — it explains what kinds of psychological data we record, how the pieces connect, and why they matter. This part is all about concepts, not code.

## The Implementation

The backend is built to serve the goals from the analysis model and frontend specs.
For the system’s structure, see [Backend System Design](./backend/system-design/README.md), which describes how each part works.

The frontend builds on top of the backend. Its documentation focuses on UI implementation — the practical side of delivering features to users.

## Congrats

You now have a solid high-level understanding of the project.
