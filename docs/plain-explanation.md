# Plain Explanation

This is how we usually explain the idea to people in a casual way.  
We hope it gives you a clearer sense of what the project is about. It’s not a simple topic, so if anything feels unclear, just let us know.

## Intro

We want to build a tool that helps us record and even somehow analyze our psychological states.  
To do that, we need a structured way of recording that actually reflects how our minds work.

We have come up with a model that records two types of data:

- **Vibe (macro level):** a general sense of how we feel over a period of time.
- **Experience (micro level):** a detailed record of what happens when certain events occur, and the feelings and reactions that follow.

For experiences, we have broken them down into four stages: **activation, reaction, coping, and post-event.**  
These seem to capture psychological shifts fairly well.

With these two kinds of records, vibes and experiences, we can form a more complete picture of our mental state.

If you’re curious, there’s more detailed documentation available.

## Challenges

Recording is straightforward. Analyzing, on the other hand, is where things get complicated, and those complications eventually feed back into how we record.

- **Vibes** are relatively simple: they’re continuous data, so they naturally give us an overall picture.
- **Experiences** are trickier: they’re event-based, usually tied to specific points in time rather than continuous flow.

That creates two main problems:

1. If we want big-picture analysis, we need a way to combine vibes and experiences, basically putting them into a format that makes sense together. Otherwise, we end up stuck, because vibes are too broad and experiences are too fragmented.
2. Emotions don’t really behave like timestamps. They’re continuous, shifting, and unpredictable. Unlike vibes, which are general, emotions fluctuate, overlap stages, and sometimes spill into other events entirely.

Solving the second problem largely solves the first. What we really need is a richer and more complex structure for experiences, something that can capture how psychological shifts actually happen.

Anyway, you get the idea, minds are really complex.
